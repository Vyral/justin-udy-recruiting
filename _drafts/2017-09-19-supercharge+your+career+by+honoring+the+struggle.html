<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKqnqk2kG9M?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-9e389b1a-9bec-4987-5bb3-3f82fe72e45f"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><i>Anything you want to do will be 10x harder than you thought it would be to accomplish.</i></span></span></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i><a href="http://saltlakecityrealestatecareers.blogspot.com/p/contact.html">Schedule a 30 Min Sit Down Today</a></i></b></div><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Reaching the next level in your career and achieving all your goals means following one simple guiding principle: <b>Honor the struggle.</b></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I learned about this principle while attending a three-day workshop run by a man named Brendon Berchard, and once he said it to me, it rang so true that I started mentioning it to my own team.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">What does it mean to honor the struggle? Let me give you an example.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">For my team and I to get from 200 transactions to 350, we’ll face the same struggle I faced to get from 100 to 200, and before that, getting from 50 to 100. In other words, going from one benchmark to the next takes double the amount of work and activity.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Anything you want to do will be 10x harder than you thought it would be to accomplish. I don’t say that in a negative way—I say it to get you motivated and excited! You know as well as I do that you’ll have 10x the blockades you previously had to reach your next goal, but once you do, you’ll get 100x more success. This is because you’re doing more, committing more, and accepting more of what you know will come your way and breaking through it, whereas other people—as much as I hate to say it—will shirk that same challenge, stop progressing, and do only enough to support their life instead of creating a bigger life for themselves.</span></span></div><br /><div class="quote-box"><span class="quote quote-left">“</span><br /><div class="quote-text">Anything you want to do will be 10x harder than you thought it would be to accomplish.     </div><br /><span class="quote quote-right">”</span></div><br /><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So, honor the struggle, honor the work, and know that it’s going to take time, effort, and energy to get to the next level.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> If you’re averaging one deal a month, do two deals from now on. If you’re average two, I want you to shoot for three. I know you can do it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">When I was on my own, I did 48 transactions one year with just a part-time assistant, so I know what it takes. Then the year I did 85 listings on my own, it was a completely different experience growing to that point.</span><br /><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One tool I recommend you use to achieve the results you want is a daily activity record.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> I used one to keep myself accountable and make sure my business grew so that I grew too and I could make a bigger life for myself and the people I work with. If you’d like a copy of the activity record sheet I use, feel free to contact me and I’d be happy to send you one.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">Otherwise, if you have any questions about honoring the struggle or would like to sit down and talk about how you can achieve all your goals and reach the next level in your career, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you. </span></div></div><div><br /></div>
