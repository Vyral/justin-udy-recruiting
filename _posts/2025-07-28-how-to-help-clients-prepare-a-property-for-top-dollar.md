Preparation is everything when it comes to helping clients sell their homes faster, for more money, and with greater satisfaction. The level of care we bring before, during, and after the sale directly impacts not only the client’s experience but also the growth of our business. More than half of our business comes from referrals, and I believe that’s because we commit to investing time, energy, and money into getting each property ready. This preparation builds trust and delivers results.

To support this, I use a home staging guide that I’ve developed over the years. Some homes are naturally show-ready, while others need more hands-on work. Either way, providing thoughtful guidance sets a high standard and gives clients the leadership they need. Here are five strategies I use to help clients prepare their homes for top dollar:<br><br>**1\. Curb appeal**. Curb appeal should never be an afterthought. First impressions matter, and that starts with the front door. If the client is not able to spend money on improvements, I may offer to buy a new doormat, paint the front door, or replace the door knocker. Sometimes I cover these upfront as part of my marketing efforts and get reimbursed at closing. You decide what works for your business, but these small touches have a big impact.

**2\. Declutter completely**. Clutter distracts from the property’s features. Encourage your clients to remove anything that doesn’t serve the space. Whether they donate, store, or sell their belongings, the goal is to help buyers focus on the home, not the stuff in it.

**3\. Maximize sunlight**. Natural light is one of the easiest ways to make a home feel larger and more inviting. Make sure blinds are open during showings and that the home is as bright as possible. Most homes are built with a boxy layout, and letting in light opens up the space and lifts the overall mood.

**4\. Prepare the home for the season**. If it’s hot outside, run the air conditioning. If it’s cold, turn on the heat. Even in vacant homes, setting the right temperature creates a more comfortable environment. It helps buyers stay longer, feel good about the space, and connect emotionally.

**5\. Have a plan**. Your clients need a clear plan for how to present their home. That includes how to stage it, how to arrange furniture, and what to remove. If this isn’t your strength, bring in a professional. I invest tens of thousands of dollars each year in staging because I believe in the power of marketing and presentation. You don’t need to overspend, but you should treat each listing as a marketing opportunity.<br><br>When we invest in our clients and their properties, it shows. A well-prepared home not only sells better, but it also creates more leads, happier clients, and more referrals.
