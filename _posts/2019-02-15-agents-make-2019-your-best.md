Even though the market is changing, there’s a lot you can do to make 2019 your best year yet. The housing forecast shows the market will likely go up in price but have fewer sales, and on top of this, there will be an influx of new agents this year. **This means you’ll need to do something different.**

When the market shifted, I dug deep and educated myself on the finer details of real estate. I flew to Chicago to learn more about financing, and that year I did 11 seller-financed deals in a market where closings just weren’t happening. **We have to be educated, and we have to be masters of conversion.**

Nobody wants to go with you unless they feel safe with you, **so here are a few ways to position yourself as a leader and as a trustworthy professional:**

**1. Have a great greeting and reach out at a high level.** You don’t want to come across badly in your first impression, so you need to really nail your phone greetings and interactions. I wear a suit not because I like it, but because it makes me look professional. In addition to acting professional, go the extra mile and learn about each client’s situation, so you can answer any questions they may have.

**2. Have a compelling argument as to how you run your business.** This is where your expertise comes into play—they’ve met you, and now they want to know if you’re a good fit. If you’re new to the business, make sure you’re educating yourself about the market and are reaching out to seasoned professionals for guidance. Their years of experience will help you.

**3. Provide an amazing customer service experience.** Too many agents see their career as a paycheck instead of as a way to help families. You need to raise your standards and level of service in order for them to refer you, come back, and continue doing business with you. People don’t remember the home you got them into—they remember the experience you provided.

If you do these three things while conducting your business, **I guarantee you’ll have more sales, more clients, and your best year ever.** If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
