One of the keys to success in this business is proper time management. Here are three reasons why:

**1\. It creates predictability in your business.** When you’re properly managing your time, you can take care of things at a very high level and create a predictable business with predictable income.

**2\. It streamlines your schedule.** As agents, we’re on other people’s time. When they’re available, we’re on. When we create a schedule to help us be proactive instead of reactive, we will always get the job done. When someone calls in and wants to see a house, you can double-check your schedule to make sure you don’t double-book and leave anyone hanging.

**3\. It reduces worry.** When you properly manage your time and have a detailed schedule, you’ll never get that feeling of forgetting something. Your schedule should consist of set times for lead generation, lead follow up, practicing scripts, writing offers, negotiating deals, and getting price reductions. Spending your time doing these things will make you the person that is producing the most income and give you a better mindset going forward so you can build a consistent business.

If you have any questions for me about time management or the business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
