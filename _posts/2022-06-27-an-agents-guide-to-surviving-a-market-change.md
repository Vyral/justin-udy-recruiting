I’ve been in up and down markets, and here’s what I’ve observed—the agents who were well-prepared and knew how to adapt to any possible dramatic changes in the market were the ones who came out on top. If you don’t prepare and innovate, you won’t be able to reach your clients on another level, and there won’t be a way for you to provide services that will give them more value.&nbsp;

**Your job as a real estate professional is to focus on prospecting, following up on leads, attending appointments, and negotiating deals.** You have to take a proactive approach to reaching out to people and stop hoping that they’ll suddenly come your way. As you see changes in the market, you have to find creative ways to respond. Help your clients understand the adjustments in value, and be aggressive when finding opportunities to make the shifting market work for you. This is how you can differentiate yourself from the competition.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>When the market is good, sometimes you don’t have to do a lot to help your clients. When homes were flying off the shelves, we could often get by doing minimal marketing and buyer outreach. When things shift, clients will start asking what exactly you’re doing for them. This is where the difference between limited service and full service approaches truly matters. **If you’re offering a limited-service approach, your clients may move on to someone offering more.**&nbsp;

Now is the time to differentiate yourself from those offering limited services. For example, many people are concerned about rising interest rates. You can get creative with loan packages so that your clients know you are rising to the challenge and meeting their needs.&nbsp;

If you want to learn more about how you can stay competitive in this shifting market, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’m always happy to help\!
