Recently, I was asked the question, “How do I get my client to change their mind about their time frame?” The answer comes down to understanding your client’s needs.

Today, I’d like to address an interesting question I received recently: **“How do I get my client to change their mind about their time frame?”**

Whether someone wants to list in the spring, wait until the end of summer, or wait until the weather gets a little colder, the key is understanding why the client thinks they need to wait.

When your client tells you they want to wait until spring, ask why doing so is important to them. This way, you can guide them with their response in mind. Asking questions like this will be key to understanding your client.

Make sure when you ask things of your client, they know that you genuinely care about their thoughts and needs. **Your client should feel and know that you truly want to understand their position.**

Once you understand their answer, you can determine whether or not what they believe actually aligns with what is going on in the market. This way, you can remain empathetic to their ideas while also leading them to make a fact-based decision.

If you present your client with information about the market, they’ll be able to think more critically about what they truly want. It all comes down to knowing the market and knowing your client.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
