I’m sharing the three keys to success in the current competitive Salt Lake City real estate market. These three things have helped me and my team for 15 years, and they can help you too.&nbsp;

**1\. Practice.** Every day you need to practice your scripts, the way you communicate, etc. This is your craft; ensure you’re conveying the message so it’s well-received, and they understand your value.

**2\. Prospect.** If we’re not prospecting, we’re never going to maximize our value, the number of people we can contact, and the amount of business we can create for ourselves. You should be making a minimum of 30 contacts per day. The year I closed 97 transactions on my own, I was doing this every day. You may not want to reach that volume of sales, and that’s okay. However, if you want to be busier than you are, do what’s necessary to reach out to people.&nbsp;

**3\. Present.** Get in front of people. Present things so that people know your value, want to work with you, and know you’ll help them reach their goals.&nbsp;

If you’re doing all three of these things, you’ll get more business and be the most successful person in your office. This is the busiest we’ve ever seen the summer market, so make these three things part of your schedule every single day to take advantage.&nbsp;

If you need anything from us or want to hear how we’re doing things in our business, reach out via phone at (801) 285-0521 or email us. We’d be happy to help you.
