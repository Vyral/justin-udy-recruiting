Sometimes we real estate agents are so busy doing our everyday business, transactions, prospecting, lead follow-up, and attending appointments that we pass up opportunities in the market.&nbsp;

**There are three questions you should consider:&nbsp;**

* How can you become your own best client?
* How can you take advantage of the market?
* How can you build wealth in real estate?&nbsp;

The home I’m standing in is an opportunity I came across recently. I took the opportunity to our team and proposed remodeling it. They were able to invest in this project, get a rate of return, and learn the process of renovation from beginning to end. Then we discussed whether to keep it or make it a long-term rental property. We talked about wealth-building strategies and short-term approaches.&nbsp;

When you’re in real estate, these are the things to contemplate. Also, **think about whether you’re aligning yourself with the right people** or getting educated so you can not only bring in business but also build wealth long term.&nbsp;

If you have questions or want to know more, we’d be glad to go over anything with you. Call or email us; we’d love to help you.
