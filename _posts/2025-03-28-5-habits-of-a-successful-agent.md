Did you know that 87% of real estate agents fail within their first two years? If you want to be part of the 13% who thrive, you need to do things differently. Many agents have built successful, long-lasting careers by following key strategies that keep them productive and profitable. Whether you’re just starting or looking to stay competitive, these five essential steps will help you succeed:<br><br>**1\. Build strong habits.** Your daily habits will make or break your career. Are you waking up early? Are you prospecting every day? Are you consistently reaching out to your sphere of influence? You need a disciplined schedule that includes business-building activities to keep things running. It’s too easy to fall behind if you have no structure.

**2\. Master time blocking.** If you want to grow, you need to set clear goals for how many people you’ll contact each day. At a minimum, aim for 20, but if you’re serious about success, push for 50, 70, or even 100. Time blocking helps you stay consistent. Work both mornings and afternoons because people answer at different times.

**3\. Be accountable.** Find someone who will keep you in check—a family member, a coach, or a broker. Set goals, define your minimum standard, and create consequences for not following through. For example, an agent hated tuna, but if he didn’t hit his numbers, he would be forced to eat it. Whatever works for you, put something in place to keep yourself disciplined.

**4\. Master your mindset.** Mindset determines success. Your mindset will determine whether you build a successful business or struggle. Some agents struggle in strong markets, while others thrive in difficult conditions. However, it all goes down to having the right attitude. Surround yourself with successful people, wake up early, take care of your health, and read inspiring books. If you start feeling down, change your environment and get back into a productive mindset.

**5\. Avoid common traps**. Don’t overspend on leads without a strong follow-up system. Avoid get-rich-quick schemes. The most well-known agent wins, but not necessarily the best one. Focus on outreach—message people, call them, leave voicemails, and send videos consistently. Make real connections and nurture relationships to grow your business.<br><br>Success in real estate requires the right mindset, daily discipline, and consistent effort.
