The market is changing in 2019, which means you have to find ways to do more with less in your business. How, though? There are a few things you can consider doing. 

If you prospect every day, for instance, your list of lead sources tends to shrink in a changing market. **Since you’re spending more time with each contact, try getting creative with the ways you connect with these people.** 

If you have a home showing scheduled at the end of the day, rather than just showing that home to a client, bring your business cards and try to do some door knocking in that area.

If you’re preparing to publish a Facebook ad, redistribute the content you’re going to use for it on other social media platforms as well. In other words, repurpose that information. 

Also, don’t forget that doing more with less also includes your expenses, so get rid of any expenses you don’t need. 

Odds are you’ve never experienced a changing market, so I want to share another important message with you: It’s not scary. On the contrary, it’s a great opportunity for you to help many more people. The agents who don’t offer a high level of service in our industry tend to fade away. **If you offer a world-class experience for your clients, though, you’re truly doing more with less, and that’s what will lead you to more business. **

As always, if you have any questions about this topic or you have another topic in mind you’d like to see me address in a future video, feel free to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you.
