If you want to reach your 2018 goals, I recommend applying the 10% rule to three areas of your life: health, wealth, and relationships.

There are three things that will be very important if you want to make this year a stronger year.

When people think about real estate, they often don’t talk about the world of health, wealth, and relationships. I have a general rule that can help you improve your life in these three areas. It’s called the 10% rule.

What does the 10% rule mean? Basically, you need to cut yourself some slack about 10% of the time.

How does the 10% rule apply to health, wealth, and relationships? Let me break it down for you:

**1. Health.** Make sure that you are eating healthy 90% of the time. The remaining 10% of the time, go ahead and have that syrupy drink or other junk food. In order to perform at your highest level, you need energy. So, eat healthy 90% of the time, and 10% of the time, allow yourself to fudge a bit while living a life of health and energy.

You have to have physical energy to be able to reach the highest level of every goal. Take care of your body and your mind, and you will be able to accomplish anything. People often set goals too low because they simply don’t have the energy to set them higher. We could accomplish even more with the 90/10 rule.

**2. Wealth.** When you’re at work, it’s natural to spend 10% of the time getting a coffee from the break room, hanging out by the water cooler, or talking to your friends. The other 90% of the time has to be productive. Make sure you do things to get you at the highest level of activity during those eight hours each day. By fully utilizing those eight hours, you are saving yourself from those 10- or 12-hour work days.

In order to be productive, keep yourself in front of people. Focus on prospecting, attending appointments, lead follow up, and negotiating deals. You can go to lunch with people, but do it for networking purposes. Instead of goofing around, that hour can be used to further your business and reach your goals.

**3. Relationships.** After a full day of work, it’s normal to feel tired. Make sure you go home with 10% still in the tank. Your family, your friends, your partner, and even your pet deserve to spend time with you.

I was completely unbalanced at the beginning of my career. I left before my kids woke up and went home before they went to bed. I was managing the team, the marketing, and hiring. I did 85 transactions personally that year. I was doing everything at work, but I was not the best dad or husband.

When you’re at work and you feel like you’ve spent 90% of your energy, go home. Give your family that time and energy. In the end, they are who we’re doing this for. We are doing this to serve our family, our friends, and other people. When we produce enough, we can give back to others.

I hope you find the 10% rule helpful in 2018. If you have any other questions about reaching your 2018 goals, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
