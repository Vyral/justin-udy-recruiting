I’m a big believer in the saying, “If you have the right tools, you can do any job.” My dad said it to me all the time growing up, and that’s always stuck with me. I’ve put on lights, numbers, switches, and plugs for clients just because I’m always prepared to help with those little things. I’m not saying you need to do that, but I am saying that preparation makes a difference.&nbsp;

These are the top three tools you need to bring with you to every single appointment:

**1\. Tape measure.** There’s always a time when people ask “How big is this?” or “What’s code on this?” By bringing in that tape measure, you’re solving a problem that could have resulted in a delay in the transaction.

**2\. Graph paper.** It sounds elementary, but this will allow you to draw out ideas that you can’t overcome because you’re physically at a property. Whether you’re working with buyers or sellers, graph paper has consistently helped me overcome objections from buyers.

**3\. Values/Data.** You need values and/or data, whether you're bringing rental rates, crime rates, comparable properties, etc. When you show up empty-handed, it seems like you’re ill-prepared. If you come with data and information, they know you’re ready to work.

With over 20,000 agents in this market, you need to show up differently. You need to look different, feel different, etc. You have to have a presence, and show up with the tools necessary so you’ll be looked at as an expert in the market.

**If you don't have the right tools and systems in your business and you’re looking to add them, our team can help.** If you have any questions or want to learn more about what we do, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
