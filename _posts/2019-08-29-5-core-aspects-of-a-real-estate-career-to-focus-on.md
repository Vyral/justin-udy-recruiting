One of the hardest challenges I ever ran into as a brand-new agent was that I was only paying attention to getting more business, closing deals, making money, and moving onto the next transaction.

**To build a true business, I should have been focusing on the five core aspects of the real estate industry:**

**1\. Lead generation.** Schedule activities in your calendar that will build your business every day, including meeting new people, networking, and doing more to put your brand in front of people.

**2\. Lead nurturing.** How do you nurture your leads? Do you use a notecard system, or do you have a CRM? Having an organized system is critical, especially if you have more leads coming in than you can handle on your own.

**3\. Conversion.** Once you have leads coming in and you’re nurturing them, make sure that you’re providing them with something of value that will help them get to the next step in their goals.

**4\. Delivery.** Make sure you follow through with the service professionally and efficiently; this involves just understanding our craft. You need to understand the “sticks and bricks” of a home, attend home inspections, and know how to negotiate in order to not only deliver the best product, but also world-class customer service.

**5\. Retention.** This is one of the biggest aspects of real estate to focus on. Did you know that it ends up costing a company almost five times as much to get a new lead than it does to keep one you already have? Don’t just help your client the one time; make sure they know you’ll help them with all their current and future real estate needs. Have a campaign, system, or process in place to reach out to past clients, be it a quarterly newsletter, a monthly call, a client event, or whatever else you can do to stay in touch with them.
