We’re roughly one month into 2021, and everyone is focused on making it their best year yet. I know you’ve likely done some goal planning, set up a vision board, and played around with tons of numbers, but here’s what I want to know: Have you had the chance to reverse-engineer what you want this year to look like? Here’s what I mean by “reverse-engineering”:&nbsp;

First, **have a visual cue in front of you.** Always know what you are working toward. As a team, we sat down and wrote out the following information on 3-by-5 cards: the income we wanted to make; the number of transactions we wanted to do in order to generate that income; and the number of daily hours prospected and appointments needed to reach that amount of transactions. By knowing this information and being able to see it every single day, even our simplest actions have direction. We each made three of these visual cue cards—one that goes in our bathrooms, one that stays in our pockets, and one for our nightstands, desks, or cars.&nbsp;

Everyone needs a clear way to measure their success. For me, I always knew that as long as I did a deal a day, I was having my most successful years. On the other hand, some successful people focus their efforts on making a minimum of 20 personal contacts each day; if they don’t, they have to pay their assistant $20. **No matter what specific system you choose, keep your eyes on the prize.**

The goal isn’t to talk to as many people as we can just for the sake of social interaction, it’s to set at least one appointment a day. If you hit that goal after talking to just three people, though, I hope you’re making 17 to 30 more phone calls because that could end up being your best day ever\!&nbsp;

I’m wishing you the best of luck in 2021. The market is rife with opportunities, and with the right mindset and focus, **it could&nbsp;*****easily &nbsp;*be your best year yet.**&nbsp;If you’re looking for a team to call home or just want some one-on-one assistance, please let me know. I’d be more than happy to chat with you\!
