Are you wondering where you can get a list of likely sellers who want to list and sell their homes? I worked with buyers and sellers in my real estate business at one point. Eventually, I transitioned to focusing solely on listings, which made a significant difference—not just in my business but in my life.

Think about three scenarios: a farmer, a fisherman, and a hunter. Each has a different approach. The farmer plants seeds and waits for them to grow. The fisherman casts a net and hopes to catch something. The hunter goes out, targets, and brings back his game. **You will either generate the opportunity or pay for it in real estate**. In a business without paying for leads, generating them yourself can be a game-changer—especially if you’re just starting. Here are three ways you can do it:

**1\. Leverage your old buyer leads.** You might have worked with buyers who didn’t purchase through you or chose another agent. *Reach out to those old buyer leads.* The likelihood that their agent is still following up with them is low. Many agents don’t maintain consistent communication after the initial transaction. Don’t be reluctant because they didn’t pick you the first time; they might not even remember. By reconnecting, you can offer value they aren’t currently receiving. When you contact them, provide something of value—perhaps a market update or a complimentary home valuation. *You’re not just asking for business; you’re offering to serve them.* Even if they’re not interested, you can ask for referrals.

**2\. Maximize your database.** Our number one lead source is past clients and referrals because we consistently reach out. *Go deeper into your database*. Start building one if you’re new and don’t have a database. Make a list of 100 people you know. Consistency is critical—ensure your name and face are always in front of them through calls, videos, social media, or emails. They need to know you’re in the real estate business and that you’re there to help. Focus on being an expert in your field. *When you strive to be the best, it shows,* and people will notice your dedication and professionalism.

**3\. Be cautious with lead generation services.** While countless lead generation services are available, not all are created equal. Keep in mind you’re either generating business or paying for it. If you choose to use these services, it’s crucial to understand your return on investment (ROI), so you know exactly where your money is going and what you can expect in return. Additionally, ensure you have a reliable system to manage and follow up with leads effectively; without that, even the best leads can slip through the cracks.

Every lead generation service requires consistent follow-up and excellent customer service. **Never break the chain in your follow-up process**. Providing value and maintaining consistent communication are essential for success.
