If you’re a new real estate agent, how can you ensure success? There’s no magic formula, but there are things you can do to get a leg up. Today I want to discuss three things you must do to succeed as an agent:

1. **Have a six-month reserve.** The six-month mark is so important because, for the first 90 days, you’re just getting your feet wet. You may know how to write a contract, but getting to the point where you’re making money could take some time. For the first three months, you’ll be absorbing everything you can. In the next three months, you’ll be making money.&nbsp;
2. **Treat this as a career.** About 87% of agents drop out of the industry within five years. That number might seem high, but if you treat this job like a career, you can easily be part of the 13% who make it. You have to put in the effort to learn what to say, network, understand the market, etc. If you do, you can provide value to your clients that will pay off over time. Don’t focus on making a certain dollar amount; instead, focus on becoming the person you need to be to make that amount.
3. **Find mentors.** If you want to be a serious producer, you can’t get there alone. Lenders are lifesavers sometimes, but they work with tons of people; you can’t rely on them to guide you every step of the way. Find a mentor you trust and absorb everything you can from them. It’s like being a chef. When you’re first starting, you need a good recipe before you can go off on your own. When I first entered this business, I had a mentor for the first six months, and the information they provided was invaluable.&nbsp;
