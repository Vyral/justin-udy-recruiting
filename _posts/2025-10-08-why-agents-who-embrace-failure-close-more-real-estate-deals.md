Are you struggling to turn prospects into deals because you’re not fully stepping into the market? Many agents miss out on opportunities simply by holding back instead of taking action. Over the past 90 days, working with other agents, it’s clear that hesitation is one of the biggest barriers to success in real estate.

Here’s why taking action and overcoming hesitation can make all the difference.<br>**<br>Deals fail when agents hold back.** Think about it: you can watch others shoot hoops or skate on ice without fear, but in real estate, hesitation stops you from taking action. Waiting to feel “ready” leaves opportunities on the table and slows your growth.

**Fear of prospecting**. Agents often hesitate because they’re unsure what to say, unfamiliar with the market, or uncertain about pricing. Some wait for the perfect setup, staging, cameras, or a polished presentation. The reality is that you’ll never be completely ready. Real growth happens when you step into the market, even imperfectly.

**Preparation matters, but it doesn’t mean perfection.** You have to take your shot, fall if needed, and get back up. Every attempt teaches you something new. Over time, this consistent action turns into experience, knowledge, and real results.<br>**<br>Your first deal is your most important teacher.** It shows you how the business works in real life. Even after completing over a thousand transactions, challenges still provide lessons. No deal is too small; every transaction builds your skill, confidence, and momentum.

**Surround yourself with winners.** Your network shapes your results. Surround yourself with agents, brokers, and mentors who are producing at a high level, know the market, and have experience building wealth. If your current environment doesn’t support growth, there are other “tribes” that will. Collaboration and mentorship accelerate learning and open doors to new opportunities.
