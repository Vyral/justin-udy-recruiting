Have you ever had a client that will just not respond? You’ve got a lead that you cant get a hold of, or maybe they even reached out to you but never answered your follow-up calls. Today we’re going to talk about a way you can get a hold of your clients and why text messaging should be a part of your follow-up process.

I have learned a couple of things in this business. One is that **everyone has a different personality, and that means they will reach out in different ways.** We typically have a schedule and routine for how we do our follow up. For example, new agents on my team prefer to text people, and sometimes are hesitant to actually ever call a client. If you have a lead who is 45, 50, or 60 years old, their preferred method of contact is probably a call or email.

It’s important to use all three methods, but I want to share a way you can amplify those texts and make sure they actually pick up. I had a gentleman reach out saying he wanted to sell his home. We have a relentless, 21-day follow-up system, and since this client was a warm lead, he was given the highest level of follow-up.&nbsp;

We used our normal methods, alternating between call, text, and email, but nothing got him to respond. **At the end of the 21 days, I decided to send him a video via text message.** I recorded the video with a handy system called BombBomb—I’m not trying to sell you on it; you could just record and send normally. But that system notifies you when they open the text. Within 10 seconds, he had opened the video. In 25 seconds, he gave me a call.

It turns out that he had a death in the family, and hadn’t been able to get back to me. After that call, **we listed his home, and it ended up being a great opportunity.** I was ready to throw that lead away, so I have two takeaways from my experience:

1\. Establish a way to connect with their preferred method of communication.

2\. Be patient. Life happens. They may not be able to respond at that time, so just try and keep reaching out. The statistics show that most people stop trying to follow up around the third call when it usually takes anywhere between eight and 13 tries to contact someone.
