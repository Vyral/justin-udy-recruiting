Have you ever had a showing where you could practically see the dollar signs in your client's eyes?

I'll tell you a little secret: it's not just about the property. It's about how you show it. After 20 years in real estate, I've refined three simple steps to transform your showings into unforgettable experiences with buyers saying 'yes' in no time.

**Step 1: Know the market better than your clients.** The first step to successful showings is to be the expert. Your clients can access vast information online, so you need to stay ahead of them. Understand the specifics of the property, the neighborhood, and even the average days on the market. If you don’t know where to start, reach out to your broker or, better yet, connect with experienced agents like me who have sold hundreds of homes. You aim to be more knowledgeable than your clients so they trust your guidance.

**Step 2: Educate yourself and your clients.** Once you have a solid understanding of the market, it’s time to educate your clients. Show them that you know how to navigate the market by explaining the details—interest rates, neighborhood dynamics, and even the motivations of other buyers and sellers. Take the time to drive around the neighborhood, research nearby listings, and understand why certain homes may have been on the market for a while. This helps your clients make informed decisions and positions you as a knowledgeable and trustworthy agent.

**Step 3: Work only with motivated clients.** The third and most crucial step is to work with motivated clients. No matter how hard you try, you can’t convince someone to buy a property if they’re not ready. Make sure your clients are serious about buying; if you sense hesitation, dig deeper. Ask questions, peel back the layers, and get to the root of their concerns. It’s like peeling an onion—keep asking until you understand what’s holding them back. This will save you time and ensure you’re working with clients and are ready to move forward when the right property comes along.

**Bonus tip: Stay ready and focused on fundamentals.** Ready to go, ready to show, and ready to help you move your business forward. Real estate is a great business; while many are struggling, you shouldn’t be. Stick to the fundamentals daily, and I promise that the roller coaster of income will smooth out.

Imagine walking into every showing with the confidence that you’re about to deliver an exceptional experience for your clients. By honing your market expertise, educating your buyers, and prioritizing motivated clients, you can elevate your showings, establish yourself as the go-to agent in your market, and build a reputation that speaks for itself.
