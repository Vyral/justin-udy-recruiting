When you’re helping a client sell a home, staging is incredibly important. This is why it’s a good idea to provide them with a staging success plan that helps them differentiate their home from the competition. There are five key reasons why creating or providing this plan can be so helpful:

**1\. It gives them an order of priority:** The staging success plan lets sellers see what they need to focus on and which items take priority. It can be challenging for sellers to go through a long list of things they need to change, but helping them figure out how and when to tackle each task makes the process much easier.

**2\. It gets the most important items done:** The success plan shows sellers which tasks will get them the biggest bang for their buck. Sometimes, you can’t do it all, so this lets them know which things to prioritize.<br>&nbsp;

**3\. You provide a standard of best practices:** This allows sellers to look at their home from the buyer’s point of view. It can be hard to take a step back, but understanding the general expectations can make it easier to be objective when staging.

**4\. It leads them to a success plan:** The plan guides them through each step and helps them move through the staging process effectively and efficiently. By knowing what’s coming and what needs to be done, the seller is able to create a better plan.

**5\. It makes you look like a market expert:** When you provide a plan, you’re also providing expertise. By educating your sellers and giving them information they otherwise wouldn’t have, you set yourself up as a go-to person for referrals and advice in the future. They’ll often want to help you build your business because you’ve helped them.
