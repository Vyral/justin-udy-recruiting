When you’re coming from a point of value and trying to help your clients, you may run into some difficulties if they have personal barriers against moving on. Sometimes, you need to give your clients real data to help get them to the next step.

How can you get your buyer or seller to the next step?

**When we’re coming from a point of value, it can be hard to assist a client who has their own barriers.** A client may say that they want to wait until spring, they want to look at other properties, or they just don’t think now is the right time.

However, these things may not actually help them get a better deal. Sometimes, you have to deal out uncomfortable truths like this to your clients. The best deal for your client might be the one right in front of them.

If they can’t see that, you may have to provide facts and data to get them to the next step. **Using real numbers and facts will help them see your points as being valid, not just some sales pitch.**

Make sure your clients know that you truly want to help them create wealth through real estate.

There are a few statistics you might want to use to put your clients on the path to the next step. First, rental rates continue to rise. Rather than continuing to pay rent, your clients might as well put funds towards homeownership.

Also, interest rates are as low as they may ever be. Waiting could be a mistake.

Sometimes, you need to give your clients real data to help get them to the next step.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
