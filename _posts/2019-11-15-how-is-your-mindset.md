Today I want to discuss the No. 1 item for success in this business: mindset. **The reason mindset is No. 1 is because it is what we carry with us all day,** every day. In the real estate business, to be the best in your office and your market, it comes down to you making sure that a positive attitude leads your thoughts consistently.

This business is difficult because people are emotional, there’s challenges with agents, sellers, and buyers, you’re dealing with title companies, mortgage people, and so on. The reason 80% of all agents leave the business within five years is because they do not have the correct mindset. You need to think about what you can do to conquer a negative mentality. Surround yourself with a positive temperament.

I have the poem “Don’t Quit” by John Whittier on my wall. I encourage you to look up this poem; it keeps me going. I also recommend you read 10 pages a day of a book that helps your mind think positively and achieve your goals. Most of the population does not do that. I personally love the book “Think and Grow Rich\!” by Napoleon Hill.

Thrust yourself into the next step in your life, **motivate yourself each day,** and find something that charges you. Additionally, remember to take care of yourself physically and mentally.&nbsp;

Also, listen to podcasts, an audiobook, or Ted Talks—make your car your university. You can even take the time to watch YouTube videos, but make sure you’re using it as a means to assist you and not a diversion that takes away from what you should be doing, such as prospecting, following up with people, negotiating deals, and getting deals done.&nbsp;

You will not see results overnight, but I promise you will over time. I’m thankful for mentors in my life that told me these are things to focus on. I hope it helps you too\!&nbsp;

If you ever have any questions about how to correct your mindset or concerning real estate, in general, please reach out to me by phone or email. I would love to help you.
