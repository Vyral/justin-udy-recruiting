If you’re like me, you’ve been seeing a change in the market. When times seem to be winding down like this, I like to think of how we can keep being great producers even during a lull in the market. Here are three ways to do it:

**1. Spend at least two hours a day on business development.** You must keep yourself accountable to this; do not take it off your calendar. You have to build your business each day, and two hours is the bare minimum.

**2. Keep 80% of your time dollar-productive.** Use this time to be working with people, negotiating contracts, and doing the things that really make you money. If you find yourself sitting around, get to work! Always be doing something that is growing your business in some way.

**3. Have your goals in front of you.** You need to know exactly where you’re going and break it down into a daily practice. As you’re doing those things each day, you’ll be coming closer and closer to reaching your goals. Set a goal each morning and accomplish that goal by the end of the day.

**On top of all this, it’s important to keep yourself accountable.** If you don’t, these straightforward routines will be nowhere near as effective as they could be. If you have any other questions or need information, reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
