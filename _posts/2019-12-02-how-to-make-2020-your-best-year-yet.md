When I meet with fellow agents, one of the biggest challenges they have is that, although they know where they want to go in their career, they haven’t set up a plan to get there.&nbsp;

**If you want to make 2020 your best year yet, start making your business plan now by setting your SMART goals:**

* Specific: Know exactly what you’re doing and where you’re going
* Measurable: Make sure you keep yourself accountable to your goals
* Achievable: Be sure your goals are attainable&nbsp;
* Relevant: Make sure your goals make sense and are something you can push toward
* Timely: Set an end date on your goals&nbsp;

As you follow this list, these criteria will help you move forward with your plan. One tip that’s always helped me is segmenting things into “one” increments: one day, one week, one month, one quarter, and one year. I have certain things I want to get done in a day, a week, a month, etc.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about setting goals or want me to provide a list of SMART goals you can follow, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to speak with you.
