I remember even as a newly licensed agent that I had a sophisticated client. At that time, I knew of someone who was doing a lot more business than I was, so I reached out to them for an hour of their time to look for some advice about how to help my client. The agent I contacted said that an hour of his time would cost me $500\! For me, however, it was worth it, so I paid the money to see what I could learn.

They walked me and one of their clients through a project and gave me all the information I needed to help me find success for my own clients. I can’t believe how valuable that $500 ended up being\!

Here are the steps that we professionals need to take if we want to maximize our clients’ value:

**1\. Educate ourselves.** If we don’t know the value, we pay the price to get the education needed to be expert advisors.

**2\. Understand the market.** The best investment properties I’ve ever purchased were in deals where the other agent didn’t know what they were doing; they didn’t understand the property’s value, location, or highest and best use. I was able to acquire the property and maximize its value.

**3\. Maximize the property.** What is the highest and best use of the property? Is it enhancing the value through improvements? Raising rents? Making sure that we’re considering the property’s location, it’s access to utilities, etc.?

When we leverage our education and expertise, that’s when we bring in our credibility, which is another way to maximize value for our clients. That, in turn, is why we as professionals need to align ourselves with a brokerage or team who can help you go above and beyond your current status.

If you have any questions about maximizing value or joining a team that provides the necessary knowledge and expertise, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you and your clients achieve the best possible results.
