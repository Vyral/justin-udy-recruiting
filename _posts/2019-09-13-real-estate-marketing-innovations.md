Real estate agents, and business people in general, are always finding ways to innovate upon their marketing techniques, and today I’d like to tell you a short story that illustrates this point.&nbsp;

At the age of 13, William Wrigley was a soap salesman. Over the years, he honed his craft, eventually offering talcum powder as a complement to his soap. He was still running this business at 30, at which time he began selling gum, too. Through his time as a salesman, he found that his talcum powder had begun selling better than his soap and eventually, that his gum was selling better than both. And thus, **the Wrigley Company was born.&nbsp;**

Now, most of us have probably had this popular chewing gum ourselves, but very few have likely heard the story of how it came to be.

But what, exactly, spurred his product to such success? Well, back in 1907 (when he had been in the business for nearly 40 years), he invested approximately $1 million into a direct-campaign letter—making Wrigley one of the first salespeople to utilize direct-mail marketing. By 1930, 65% of people surveyed said they believed Wrigley to be the best gum company in the nation. Over time, William Wrigley became so successful that he even went on to purchase Catalina Island. And the company is still going strong today—they actually have a hedge fund that generates billions of dollars each year.&nbsp;

**The bottom line is that amazing things happen when you innovate upon the five core functions of a business (lead generation, nurturing, lead conversion, delivery, and retention).&nbsp;**

So, pick a niche you’re familiar with, and then delve deep on honing it. When you market your business, you’re marketing yourself. And, of course, once you attract people through your marketing, you must provide a world-class experience to those customers.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
