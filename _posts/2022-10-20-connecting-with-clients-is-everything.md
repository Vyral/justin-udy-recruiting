Are you educating and informing your clients? Are you consistently making emotional deposits to have a deeper relationship and make sure that you're top of mind? Staying top of mind with your clients is a great way to maintain a steady stream of leads, but how can you do it?

I just got done filming a video for our clients to inform them about our annual client appreciation event. At this event, we provide a catered lunch and a free pie giveaway. We do face painting, play games, and have giveaways, but the biggest reason that we do this is that it gives us the opportunity to connect with our clients.

It’s a good idea to call your clients regularly; I recommend at least once a quarter. However, it’s not the same as seeing someone face to face. Typically, **you need to be in front of people at least 24 times within a calendar year** to keep them warmand help them remember that you are a professional real estate agent.&nbsp;

With events, we always incorporate our core values. For example, we're going to sponsor a charity for this one. In other years we've done a variety of things, but it needs to be true to you. Also, **make sure your event is relevant to your clientele.** Aim the theme toward their genders, ages, and interests. Our job is to make these small deposits over time so that we are a trusted source they know.

These events are great because they help you get to know your clients outside of a work situation. You won’t be in a suit and tie, and it will help your later communication feel like a friend following up, not a salesperson. You could reach out with something as easy as, “Hey, I'm in the area, and I'm going to drop by Starbucks. What do you want?” Keeping people informed is important, but building a long-term relationship is crucial.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how this could work for you, please call or email me. I am always willing to discuss your business or career with you.
