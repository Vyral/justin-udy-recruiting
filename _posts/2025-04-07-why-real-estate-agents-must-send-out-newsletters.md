As a real estate agent, you’re always looking for ways to stay ahead of the competition and build lasting relationships with your clients. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through a newsletter. If you’re wondering what makes a newsletter truly powerful, here’s how it can benefit you and your business:<br><br>**1\. It keeps you top of mind.** A physical newsletter is a great way to keep your name in front of clients. Unlike emails that are easily ignored, a newsletter in the mailbox stands out. Even if they don’t keep it, the fact that they’ve seen your name reminds them that you’re the go-to agent when they’re ready to make a move.

**2\. It builds your authority.** A newsletter helps you build authority by sharing your unique perspective on the market. By sharing your perspective on the current market, you demonstrate that you’re not just another real estate agent; you’re a trusted advisor with valuable insights. The more you share your knowledge, the more you position yourself as the most reliable person in your field.

**3\. Educational and informational.** Newsletters are a valuable tool for educating clients. You can share market updates, tips on selling, or advice on buying. By providing useful information, you show clients that you’re knowledgeable and up-to-date on the latest trends.

For example, one client came into my office ready to sell their home. They had a folder full of newsletters I had sent over the years. She said that after receiving my newsletters and invites to events, she knew exactly who she was going to call when she was ready to sell. This experience of mine proves how useful and powerful newsletters are.

Sending out newsletters also helps you stay sharp by forcing you to keep up with the market and ensures you’re always visible to clients, which increases the chances they’ll reach out when they need you. Newsletters often get passed along to friends and family, increasing the chances of gaining new business.<br><br>If you need help creating your newsletter or want coaching on how to make it more effective, please reach out.
