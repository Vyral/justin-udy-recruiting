I’m excited to talk to you about how you can dig deep to find new business and new opportunities for you and your clients. Many people don't plan ahead when they're thinking about how to connect with new clients and generate opportunities. **You need to be prospecting-based, but also marketing-enhanced.** You need to reach out to people every day, but there are other things that we can add after our prospecting time to have a thriving business

If there’s an important date coming up, mark it on your calendar, come up with an idea for that date, and then execute it. Some of the things we do are giveaways, client events, donation drives, and holiday cards. These small, thoughtful things can make a difference. Even if your budget is small, take the time one day to write out a message to your people. Use this time of year to dig deep into other opportunities.

It’s tough prospecting every day, but **when you schedule a time to work on that month’s outreach project, it becomes a lot easier.** Sending a video, physical mail, and even making phone calls will make you stand out in this business of connections. This is an extra way to dig a little bit deeper with your clients, get them to know you, and remember you.

If you'd like a free business consultation or have any questions, reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
