As the saying goes, “Knowledge is power,” and what better way is there to learn than by reading? Today I’d like to share three incredible books that have definitely shaped the way I approach my life and my career.&nbsp;

**1\. “Think and Grow Rich” by Napoleon Hill.** This is my go-to book to give as a gift every time someone in my life has a child graduating from college, high school, or even middle school. It’s just that powerful.&nbsp;

Despite what the word “rich” being in the title might make you think, this book isn’t just about how to build financial wealth. Its lessons also teach readers how to become “rich” mentally. The main thing to take away from this book is the importance of being optimistic and productive. Having a positive outlook, while still being proactive in making good things happen, is essential to “thinking and growing rich.”

**2\. “Why Now Is the Time to Crush It\! Cash in on Your Passion” by Gary Vaynerchuk.** This book, which I got my hands on years ago when it was first published, has continued to be one of the most impactful books I’ve ever read. It taught me how to effectively operate in my market without having a huge budget to work off of. I learned the importance of consistent prospecting—something that’s still crucial to my business today.&nbsp;

**3\. “The E Myth” by Michael E. Gerber.** Agents work themselves to the bone trying to earn their keep through commissions. All too often, this involves wearing more “hats” than we can handle. The reality is that to run a successful business, you need different people filling different, specific roles. Finding your niche and sticking to it is essential. Beyond that, you need to collaborate with other people who can fill the other necessary roles a real estate business must have to function. It was only after I did this, myself, that my production started increasing exponentially. Now, my team and I do hundreds of transactions each year.&nbsp;

Even by reading just 10 pages a day, you can consume more than 20 books every single year. And I promise you that the more you read, the more you’ll grow.

If you have any other questions or would like more information about any of these books, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
