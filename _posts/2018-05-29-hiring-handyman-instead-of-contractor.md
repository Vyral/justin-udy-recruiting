Are you considering a handyman over a professional contractor to get your small repairs completed? Today I have a list of the pros and cons of hiring a handyman to help you decide which is best for your situation.

The pros of hiring a handyman are:  

**1. There are more options for you to consider hiring.** Lots of people are able to complete your job and can help you.

**2. They may have more open availability.** You will most likely not have to wait for them to get out and fix your issues.

**3. You can save money.** The costs for handymen are sometimes significantly cheaper than contractors. And, they can usually do it quickly.

The cons, meanwhile, are:

1. They lack expertise in certain areas. They cannot be fully trained in every aspectâ€”just their trade.

**2. A handyman could cause serious damages later.** An incorrectly installed light switch could lead to a fire.  

**3. A lot of times, they do not have proper insurance.** If something does go wrong, they are unable to back it up.

**4. You get what you pay for.** I would not recommend hiring a professional with an extremely high fee. However, you do not want to pay the least amount and get the worst quality as well.

When you are looking at pros and cons for the people that you are hiring, I believe you should choose the person who is going to do the best job. Whether that person is a professional, a handyman, or just someone that is assisting you because they have done a certain task well before, choose the person that is the right fit for you.

If you have any questions about this, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to assist in any way that I can.
