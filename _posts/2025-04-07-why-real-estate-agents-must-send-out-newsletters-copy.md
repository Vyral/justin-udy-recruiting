In my biggest year ever, I sold 97 homes. These listings are ones that I secured on my own. I know I could have reached my goal of 100 if I hadn’t made a few mistakes, but once I made some important changes, I saw my listings double.

There are two main areas of focus that helped me convert more appointments into listings. First, I had to shift my mindset. When I focused too much on commissions or money, it pulled me away from thinking about how I could best serve the seller. The other key was mastering the listing presentation.

**Mastering the listing presentation.** Sellers want structure. They want to know what I do, how I do it, and how I’m going to help them. Think of it like this—any time I’ve hired someone or brought them onto my team, I’ve looked at a resume to understand their experience. Clients are no different.

This is why I update my resume every year and include it in my listing presentation. I want to show people how I run my business. Whether it's a pamphlet, PowerPoint, or simply a structured conversation, I follow a clear, repeatable process. Sellers often tell me they’re shocked at how thorough I am compared to other agents who just show up with a few papers and start talking.

**Mastering seller psychology.** To double my listings, I also had to understand seller psychology. As consumers, we all fear the same things: lack of security, unpredictability, and uncertainty. This is why my listing presentation is designed to address those concerns upfront, even before they are expressed.

By proactively acknowledging what sellers are often already worried about, I build trust early in the process. Over the years, I have tracked every question, concern, or objection that has come up during presentations and refined my approach to include clear, confident responses to each one. This ensures sellers feel fully informed and reassured throughout the process.

**Common seller concerns.** Over time, I’ve found that sellers typically have three primary concerns:

**1\. Emotional attachment versus market reality.** Many sellers are tied to their homes emotionally. It’s your job to understand and present market value clearly, so the property sells instead of sitting unsold.

**2\. Undervaluing.** Sellers worry that you’ll price it too low. Just this week, I had a woman who wanted to list her home for $725,000 when it was only worth $600,000. Someone else will take that listing, but it will sit on the market and never sell. I went over every single sale, every comp, days on the market, and even expired and canceled listings. She still held on to her number, and this is completely fine because not every homeowner is a seller. But it’s my job to present the facts and help them understand.

**3\. Certainty and control.** Sellers want to know what will happen. I give guarantees. I tell investors, “If you don’t make money, I don’t make money.” I’ve even sold homes for free if the client didn’t profit. This gives them confidence and control over their pricing and risk.

**Details matter.** As an agent, I know that small details matter. From understanding market value to staying in regular contact, everything I do is focused on providing my clients with the certainty, security, and predictability they need.

I also build incentives into my process. Offering guarantees and showing my commitment to getting the best results helps clients feel confident and in control, which leads to trust and stronger relationships.

If you’re looking to double your listings and increase your success as an agent, mastering the listing presentation and understanding seller psychology are essential. Offering a structured approach, addressing sellers’ concerns, and providing them with security and certainty, can increase your chances of doubling your listings.
