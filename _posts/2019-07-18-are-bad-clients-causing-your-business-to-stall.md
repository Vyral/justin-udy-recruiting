When it comes to having a profitable real estate career, choosing the right clients is as important as any other step you can take.&nbsp;

To illustrate this, I like to use the example of one of my son’s baseball games. He was seven at the time and kept swinging at pitches that were, to put it gently, not the best. I remember encouraging him later to not swing at those pitches, and, thinking about it now, that’s exactly the point I’m trying to make today.

**Fellow agents: It’s time to stop swinging at bad pitches.** Just because an opportunity comes your way, that doesn’t mean you need to pursue it.

But what if you don’t have the time or expertise to be selective about your clients? What if you don’t have enough leads in your pipeline?

Well, ultimately, it’s best to realize that even in those circumstances, wasting your time on bad clients will only harm you in the long run. That time could be better spent on developing your skills and padding out your pipeline so that you can afford to be selective.&nbsp;

**Channeling your time and energy into positive opportunities and people will always be a better choice than the alternative.** While I generally believe people are good at their core, there are unfortunately some emotional vampires out there who drain your energy, your resources, and your emotional wellbeing.&nbsp;

So not only can bad clients be detrimental from a business perspective, they can also be harmful on a personal level, as well.&nbsp;

Thankfully, you have the control to avoid these kinds of people in your real estate career. Remember: What you do today will impact what happens to you three months down the line. In other words, make every moment of every day count. Your future self will be grateful for it.

**At the end of the day, so long as your pipeline is full (which on my team means having at least 16 people in it), and your practices are sound, you and your business will be in good shape.** Not only that, but when you make running a good business a priority, you’ll attract good people and good opportunities.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
