Here at the Justin Udy Team, we’re looking for success-minded individuals to fill the open positions we have available. Whether they’re looking to grow their careers or are just entering the real estate business, there are a number of things that agents look for to achieve success. Here’s what we offer our agents that’s different than what you might get on other teams:

**1\. Training.** You’ll receive one-on-one training with someone who’s done over 1,000 transactions. I’ve handled 97 transactions this year alone, and my team has handled 151. Only a select few agents have handled that kind of volume. If you’re looking at creating a high level of business and building wealth, this will be a different place for you.&nbsp;

**2\. Leads.** We have a number of lead sources. I graduated from the University of Utah with a marketing degree, and I love marketing. Maybe you’ve seen it, maybe you haven’t, but our marketing is very broad and deep. Therefore, we have hot lead sources. We also have cold lead sources that we have to nurture. In any case, when you have a number of lead sources, it provides you with more opportunities you can convert. I’ve found that the hardest thing to do in this business is get in front of people. This means either paying for leads or getting them on your own. I cold called leads for years—50% of them came from my cold calls, and the other 50% came from people I already knew or past clients.&nbsp;

**3\. Equity.** We have deals that arrive in our office all the time that we purchase as a team. This year we bought two properties we decided to invest in together, and we went through the entire renovation process before having to decide whether to sell it, keep it, or use it as a future investment. Everyone on the team got their returns and learned what they needed to learn. Knowing how to build wealth is my No. 1 priority. Obviously I want my team members to build income and have an amazing experience, but we emphasize building wealth on our team. I’ve been blessed to have enough investment properties to cover all my expenses by the time I was 39.&nbsp;

**4\. Support.** Our team has a listing coordinator, transaction coordinator, marketing specialist, and social media assistant. Having this type of support in place allows you to focus your time and energy on your most productive tasks: prospecting, lead follow-up, attending appointments, and negotiating deals. If you can spend all your time in that zone, you’ll make 10x the money you’re making now. Having this support system is the only way I’ve been able to do close to 100 deals a year.&nbsp;

**5\. Office space/materials.** Converting leads is important, but you need to be in a place that elevates your standards. We have homebuyer guides, scripts, and client roadmaps you can review. Having materials in place outlining topics I advise people on will help you become an expert advisor in the eyes of potential clients. You’ll be seen as knowledgeable, someone they’re comfortable with, and someone they want to work with.&nbsp;

**6\. Team.** A team environment is different from being solo. Having standards and core values in place (along with people who embody those values) will create a different mindset that initiates that kind of growth you wouldn’t get on your own.&nbsp;

If you’re looking to accelerate your growth, earn a higher income, and build a different level of professionalism, fill out your application to join us here. If you’re on the fence about making this step and would like to know more about what we can offer you, give me a call today. I look forward to hearing from you\!
