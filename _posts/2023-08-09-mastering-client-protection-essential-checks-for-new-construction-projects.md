Do you know how to protect your client when you’re representing them on a new construction project? Today, I’m here to talk about a few of the key factors I’ve learned to check to save myself and provide top-notch service to my clients.&nbsp;

**1\. Understand their reputation and reviews.** Start by doing a background check and a credit check on the builder. This will help you understand where they’ve been and what they’re doing now. A new-construction project is stressful enough without running into issues with the builder, so make sure you understand the dynamics of the individual builder, not their company. One great way to do this is to look at their reviews, especially to see how many have in correlation with how many projects they do.

**2\. Understand the quality of their craftsmanship.** You can go to a project and ask the people working there how they like working with that contractor. You can also call the city. Do whatever it takes to understand the dynamics of that team. Also, find out if they use durable materials, what the team is like, if they have a list of vendors that you can see, and if there are properties that they’ve worked on that you can visit.&nbsp;

**3\. Understand their warranties and ask important questions.** Make sure you understand what warranty the builder uses, how long it lasts, and who you would be in contact with. Warranties are required in Utah, but does this builder offer any extended warranties on top of what is required?&nbsp;

Understanding these three things will help you protect your business and your client. I’ve learned the hard way that common sense isn’t common practice, so I know that if you do these things, you can save yourself the heartache and deliver amazing service to your clients. If you have any questions about this or anything else related to building your business, don’t hesitate to reach out. You can call or email me anytime and I would be happy to help you.
