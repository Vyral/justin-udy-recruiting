The Wasatch Front market has a serious pricing problem. Homes are now sitting on the market for an average of 69 days, leaving sellers frustrated and buyers hesitant. Meanwhile, some listings are moving in less than 25 days, which begs the question: What’s the difference? It all comes down to pricing. Sellers expect results, and when a home lingers too long, they start questioning everything. Overpricing can kill momentum, but the right pricing strategy can get a home sold fast. Here are three key factors to consider when setting the right price:<br><br>**1\. Comparable sales.** Looking at comparable sales is essential, but accuracy is everything. A true comparison means evaluating properties that are similar in style, size, and features. A two-story home should not be compared to ramblers because they attract different buyers. Mixing property types leads to unrealistic pricing, making it harder to sell quickly. Keeping comparisons as close as possible ensures a competitive price that will attract serious buyers.

**2\. Expired listings.** Expired listings can reveal major pricing mistakes. If similar homes have been pulled off the market, it is important to ask why. Was the price too high? Were there issues with the home? Calling the previous listing agent can provide useful insights. If multiple homes in the area have struggled to sell, it may be time to adjust pricing expectations.

**3\. Current market conditions.** Market conditions and interest rates also play a huge role. Right now, more deals are falling apart than ever, and many sellers are looking for agents who can fix their broken transactions. One way to stay ahead is by preparing for rate buy-downs, which make homes more appealing to buyers. Setting a price that factors in current conditions keeps a listing competitive and prevents it from sitting too long.<br><br>Pricing a home correctly leads to faster sales, happier sellers, and more referrals. It also makes an impression on neighbors who are watching the market. When a home sells quickly, others take notice, creating more opportunities for future business.
