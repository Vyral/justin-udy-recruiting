Is your 2025 heading toward a quiet finish? For many agents, the fourth quarter feels like a slow fade. But the ones who finish strong use this time as a launchpad. They shift from worry to action. They stop guessing where business will come from and start focusing on the sources that consistently produce results.

If you feel like you are busy but not productive, or worse, stuck with no momentum, this is exactly the reset you need.

Here are my top five zero-cost lead sources to close this year strong.

**1\. Your sphere of influence.** You do business with people you know. And the people who already know you are the easiest to connect with, as long as you keep the conversation natural. Face-to-face is the highest level of touch. A simple lunch with a key contact can lead to twenty referrals a year.

In my very first week in real estate, I called my entire sphere. One person they connected me to has resulted in thirty deals over the years. That is the power of being consistent and normal in your outreach. Skip the needy lines.

Try something simple like, “I am helping a few families get moved before the holidays or ready for early January. Who do you know that might need help?” It frames you as a resource, not someone begging for business.

The more conversations you have, the more opportunities appear. That will never change.

**2\. Absentee owners and landlords.** When the market shifts, landlords feel it first. Vacancies, rising costs, and tenant issues push them toward selling long before they say it out loud.

I used to call every landlord who advertised in the newspaper, saving the ads and calling them again a year later as leases expired. Some recognized my voice because they had heard from me so often, and that familiarity opened doors. Ask simple questions like, “Looks like you have a vacancy coming up. Have you considered selling or exploring options that might earn you more?”

Even if they are not ready today, they remember you when they are. Conversations with landlords have led to half my multifamily and commercial investment deals.

**3\. Past or expired listings.** Just because the listing expired does not mean their desire to move disappeared. Most of these owners are on the sidelines because they do not understand today’s market. Rates changed. Inventory shifted. A neighbor gave them bad advice.

You can be the person who brings clarity. Explain that well-priced and well-marketed homes are still getting multiple offers, while stale listings are sitting. When you show them the real data, you reopen a door that most agents walked past.

A respectful, informed conversation can revive an opportunity that everyone else forgot.

**4\. Builder trade-ups.** You do not need a builder account to win here. Builder accounts can be great, but they can also be demanding. What you do need is a connection with the sales reps.

Every buyer walking into a model home likely has a property to sell. Your offer is straightforward.

“I know you see a lot of buyers who need to sell quickly. I can be your resource.”

This is seed planting. Some leads sprout soon. Some take time. All of it builds momentum when you stay consistent.

**5\. Local Facebook groups and communities.** People work with the people they communicate with. And your local groups are full of future sellers who are asking questions, exploring options, and trying to figure out their next move.

When someone posts about relocating, do not reply with “call me.” Instead, send a private message. Even better, send a quick video so they see you are a real person. Share a story about how you recently helped someone, or mention that you also find off-market opportunities.

Off-market does not mean mysterious. FSBOs, wholesalers, and your own network count. These opportunities appear because you stay active.

If your Q4 plan doesn’t include these five strategies, you’re leaving momentum on the table. The fourth quarter is not a time to slow down; it’s your chance to build a foundation for next year while closing this one strong.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. You can call me at ** ** [**(801) 285-0521**](tel:&#40;801&#41;%20285-0521) or email me at [**Justin@JustinUdy.com**](mailto:Justin@JustinUdy.com)**.** I’d be happy to go on a quick strategy call to discuss your Q4 goals.

Let’s make this quarter your best one yet.
