One of the biggest challenges we run into in this business is the dilemma of paying for leads versus generating them yourself. I was talking to a fellow agent recently who said that they both have a price: Either you generate leads that will demand time and rejection to convert, or you pay for leads that will demand patience and perseverance to convert.

This is a social business, and we have to know how to sell. **The No. 1 thing you need to know in order to have success is your scripts and dialogue so you can communicate with people properly.** Prospecting, lead follow up, attending appointments, and negotiating deals will make you the most money in this business.

The next thing you need to do is stick to a true schedule. If you contact 30 leads per day, five should be from your sphere of influence. **You can learn more about who should be in your sphere in our [recent video.](https://utahrealestatetraining.com/the-true-power-of-database-marketing.html){: target="_blank"}**

Once we’re contacting our sphere, now we need to timeblock the following things in our schedule:

* Lead follow up
* Sending thank-you notes
* Social media

**Each of these tasks doesn’t take much time on their own, but put together, you can broadcast your message to so many more people.&nbsp;**

Finally, you need someone to hold you accountable. One of the best things I ever did was put $20 on my assistant’s desk. If I did not make my contacts that day, that $20 went right into her pocket. Having to pay her that $20 was painful. It happened once, and I never let it happen again. That kept me accountable to my goals and ultimately led to my success in this business.
