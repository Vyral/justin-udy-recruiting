Wondering how to boost your visibility in the real estate market? With many other agents in the area, you’ll need to shift your strategy to get ahead. One of the most effective strategies is pretty simple yet powerful: create and share regular market update videos.

There are three key reasons why this approach works:

1\. It increases your visibility so potential clients see you more often.

2\. It positions you as a market expert.

3\. It adds value when you meet with buyers and sellers because you have up-to-date data.

For example, knowing detailed information about the Wasatch Front real estate market is crucial. Do you know whether inventory is rising or falling? What is happening to average price points or price per square foot? Being aware of these details separates experts from others.

Whenever someone asks me about a neighborhood, I can share facts such as how much inventory has increased, how many listings are active, and how many homes have gone under contract recently.

**Learning the hard way.** In the past, I lost appointments because I did not have the answers when clients asked questions. I had to research the market after the fact, which was inefficient and costly. By consistently sharing market updates, I was able to increase my sales significantly, from selling around 30 to 40 homes a year to nearly 100 in a single year. This shift happened because I changed how prepared I was and the information I had ready to share.

**Use social media videos.** If you want to get in front of more people, my recommendation is to use social media videos to provide market updates regularly. Even if you have nothing else to share, delivering a market update monthly or quarterly keeps you relevant. I do updates at the beginning of the year, at the end of the year, and at several points throughout. You can also create printed copies of these updates to send to clients, offering to discuss their home’s current value. This way, you become the trusted expert they turn to when evaluating their real estate options.

**Create engagement opportunities.** Using social media should be about more than just posting casually. It is a tool for visibility and creating opportunities. You want to place your content in people’s inboxes and feeds so they think of you when they need help. For instance, on my Instagram, I document my day-to-day activities—buying investment properties, renovating homes, managing rentals, listing homes, and closing sales. This creates conversations and attracts inquiries from potential clients with various needs.

The key to success is consistency. Schedule time to create and share these updates, and make it part of your routine. The more opportunities you create for people to see you, the more your business will grow. If you have questions or need guidance, just reach out.
