Although a surprising number of agents don’t discuss or use database marketing in their business, it’s such an instrumental part of your success in this business. I made the same mistake when I got my start.&nbsp;

I once closed 97 transactions in a single year, and without an effective database marketing strategy in place, I would have been stretched much too thin to keep in touch with each and every client in my database.&nbsp;

On my team, **our clients are our top source for both referrals and business, and achieving that with such success is only possible by staying in touch with our clients in a systematic and consistent manner.**&nbsp;

There are a few techniques you can integrate into your business to sharpen your database marketing that I’ll go into today.&nbsp;

The first technique is to **call everyone in your database at least once every quarter.** If you’ve neglected to do this up until now, give them a call and reestablish a connection with them. Let them know that you’re sorry you haven’t been in touch and that you’re there if they need anything.&nbsp;

In addition to this, we **send out two educational video messages each month** to demonstrate the breadth of our knowledge and expertise, which gives them confidence that we’ll help them reach their real estate goals.&nbsp;

**Consider organizing client appreciation events.** Just recently, my team and I recorded a video that we’ll use to alert clients to an upcoming movie event we’re holding. We’ll host another around Thanksgiving time and then again next March. As a pro tip, schedule them in such a way that they’re three or four months apart.&nbsp;

Another thing that will prove to be beneficial is to **construct and send out a newsletter to everyone in your database.** For our part, my team and I have been sending one out every quarter, but are planning to increase the frequency to every month or every two months. Doing this allows you to position yourself as an authority and provides something tangible that your clients can associate you with.

Because all these strategies and systems require some form of planning, they’ll be on your calendar, which will allow you to **stay task-oriented and top of mind with the clients who make up your database.** Not only that, but showing consistency also sends the message that you’re an established professional. The message doesn’t have to be all real estate all the time, either: Calling them personally and extending an invite to coffee or stopping by a client’s home to deliver cookies for their birthday works just as well.&nbsp;

One point that bears repeating is that **your clients need to see that you’re consistent.** As soon as you start to make great strides in your business, it’s easy to slack in this department, but clients need to know you’re here to stay. 85% of agents are out of the business in their first five years, so people want to know they can place their trust in your hands with regard to their biggest asset. &nbsp;&nbsp;
