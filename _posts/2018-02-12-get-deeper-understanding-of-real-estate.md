I’m excited to tell you about my podcast, which allows me to delve deeper into the topics that you want to learn about.

<div class="post-cta">

I’m very excited about the podcast we have coming out. If you’ve been listening to the short videos we’ve been making, you’ll notice that I’ve been scratching the surface on a few different important topics. This podcast gives me the ability to go a deeper into these discussions.

On today’s podcast, I interviewed the CEO of Century 21 Global. In that, you can listen to a little over 40 minutes of him discussing how he went from being a solo agent to a business owner and a CEO of a global franchise, building teams and leadership skills, and the experiences he’s had over the course of his career.

Whether you’re a solo agent, you’re growing a team, or you’re looking to do more, I really hope that this will give you some amazing information.
