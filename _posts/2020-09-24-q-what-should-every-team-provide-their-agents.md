Today I wanted to let you know that we’re hiring for a few positions. If you’re considering joining a team and looking for opportunities, [follow this link](https://www.justinudy.com/connect){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and you can reach out to us from there. If you’re not sure what’s right for you, here are the five things a team or brokerage should be giving you, and that we here at Justin Udy & Team Real Estate always provide:

**1\. Leads.** We provide leads and opportunities where you can close transactions.

**2\. Training.** Our team has closed over 200 transactions in a year, but there are brokers out there who haven’t closed even 20 deals per year. You need real, boots-on-the-ground experience in how to work with people and do residential, land, multi-family, and commercial real estate so you have broad knowledge. That doesn’t mean you need to focus on all these things, but as market experts, we should definitely know about them. Be around people who will elevate your experience and feed the mindset that you can do 100 transactions in a year. When we train agents, we teach them how to provide a world-class experience so that we remain distinct.&nbsp;

**3\. Support.** We ensure we’re providing you the tools and resources you need so you can spend your time doing dollar-producing activities. As real estate agents, we’re always juggling many plates, but if you can focus on your most productive tasks, not only do you make more money, but you also spend more time on the things that matter most. For example, on our team, if you go on vacation, you don’t have to be constantly checking your phone. We have support team members who can take on business and assist you while you’re taking care of other things that matter, like your personal life.&nbsp;

**4\. Equity.** You need to be your own best client. Take advantage of the opportunities that come your way. For example, I purchased two properties recently and took them to the team to ask who wanted to be involved in the transactions. Interested team members put money in and made money on the transaction because they took advantage of the market; they’re building wealth.&nbsp;

**5\. Growth.** My job is to lead, motivate, keep people accountable, and work on large deals. I am always trying to figure out how we can get to the next level. This means growing together.&nbsp;

So if you’re looking for an opportunity or know someone who may be interested, please have them reach out to us. We have a few positions open. We work very hard, we’re systematic, and we keep each other accountable.&nbsp;

If you think you’d be a good fit for our team, we’d love to see your resume. I’d also be glad to speak with you one-on-one. We hope to hear from you soon\!
