As you enter the market as a brand-new agent, sometimes you get in front of someone who’s a good salesperson, and sometimes you get in front of someone who’s a good consultant. Who are you—a salesperson or a consultant?

**In my opinion, you have to be both.** A good salesperson isn’t someone who sneaks a person into a deal. A good salesperson has a daily schedule and knows how many people they have to talk to to build a massive pipeline because they know they’re in the business of selling. However, if a salesperson has what we call ‘commission breath’ (i.e., they’re just looking for the money), that can also shape our definition of the word ‘salesperson.’ I never really considered myself a salesperson, but I will say that I’m in the business of sales.&nbsp;

**As a consultant, people look at you differently.** To explain why, let me tell you a story about one of my best clients, who I’ve made over $100,000 with in gross commission. He had an agent he worked with for many years on his own. I know this agent; he’s a good guy and a true salesperson. What I didn’t know was that, for one property in particular, he was taking this salesperson and me to visit it separately without either of us knowing. When he asked my opinion about the property, which was listed at about $1.3 or $1.4 million, I told him I thought it was overpriced. When he asked why, I went through a checklist of items to explain, but then he said he thought it would make a great rental.&nbsp;

I was taken aback. *A rental?* I told him I could get him into several multi-unit properties with better cash flow and better tenants for less than that, and he wouldn’t have to worry about destroying a $1.4 million asset. I didn’t even pay $1.4 million to purchase my 8-plex\! What’s funny is that, as I was telling him this, I noticed his wife in the background thanking me. I eventually found out that the salesperson—who’d helped them with dozens of transactions over the years—was trying to convince him that it was the perfect rental property and that he should pay full price for it.&nbsp;

When I came in, I simply gave him my true opinion on the matter. It’s not that I thought the salesperson was wrong, per se; it’s just that there’s a different way of consulting a client through the buying process. That means being authoritative and providing facts—stuff that won’t pad my pocketbook but will assist the client in making a more informed decision and have a better home purchase experience. After that exchange, he stopped working with that agent and started working with me. Multiple transactions later, I’m still in touch with this client. In fact, he recently spoke with me about wanting three additional properties in a different location.&nbsp;

So again, are you a salesperson or a consultant? I’ll say this: If you provide your clients world-class service and meet their needs at every level, they’ll always come back to you.&nbsp;

If you’d like to schedule a one-on-one consultation about your business or are looking to join a team with the same goals you have, get in touch with me today. I’d love to speak with you.
