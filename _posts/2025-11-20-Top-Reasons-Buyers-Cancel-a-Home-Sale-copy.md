If you want to give your clients a better experience and keep your deals on track, you need more than hard work and good instincts. You need the right people around you. I learned early in my career that no agent can answer every question or handle every issue alone, and agents who try to do everything themselves often run into problems that could’ve been prevented.

When you build a strong network, you gain clarity, confidence, and support, and your clients feel that strength throughout the process. **These are the three relationships that changed the way I work and helped me serve my clients at a higher level.**

**Planning and zoning office personnel.** Your clients will always want to know what they can do with a property, which is why having a direct contact in the planning and zoning office is one of the most valuable relationships you can build.

Buyers ask if they can rent the home, run nightly rentals, make changes, or use it for a small business, and zoning rules are the only reliable source of truth. On top of zoning, many homes also have covenants or HOA restrictions that can further limit use.

I’ve seen the consequences of skipping this step, and it can get expensive fast. I stayed in an Airbnb where a notice appeared on the door on day two stating that the rental wasn’t allowed and that a $750 fine would be issued. The host told me they had no idea the zoning didn’t permit short-term rentals. They’d already spent time, money, and effort preparing the property, only to find out they couldn’t use it the way they planned. Buyers depend on us to help them avoid situations like that, which is why zoning knowledge is essential.

**Home inspector.** A reliable home inspector is another key partner, and it’s even better when they bring a strong network of specialists. Many inspections uncover issues that need deeper evaluation. You might need an engineer, electrician, plumber, or another professional who can step in quickly and give clear answers.

When your inspector has access to these resources, you can help your clients better understand the property and guide them with confidence. Buyers feel supported when you can walk them through concerns with the right people involved, and that level of preparation helps prevent surprises that could slow down or threaten the deal. A strong inspector with a strong network protects your clients and strengthens your service.

**Lender and title rep.** A dependable lender and title rep are essential because they help carry your deal from contract to closing. Clients often reach out to ask whether the deal is still on track, and the truth is that nothing is final until closing is complete. A good lender communicates well, works through problems, and stays engaged throughout the loan process. A strong title rep reviews the title report and alerts you to concerns such as easements, fees, or restrictions that can delay or complicate a sale.

If you’re not reading your title report, you’re missing key details about the property, and that’s where a great title rep becomes invaluable. These partners help protect your clients from unexpected issues and keep the deal moving forward.

Surrounding myself with reliable and knowledgeable professionals changed my business. Deals became smoother, problems were solved faster, and clients trusted the process more. That trust led to more referrals, which in turn generated more income. Strong partners make you better at what you do and allow you to deliver a higher level of service without carrying the entire load alone.

Building a strong network doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. With the right people around you, you can protect your clients, solve problems early, and create smoother transactions from start to finish.<br><br>If you’d like help building your own team of trusted contacts or guidance on strengthening your process, feel free to call or text me at [**(801) 285-0521**](tel:8012850521){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [**Justin@JustinUdy.com**](mailto:Justin@JustinUdy.com).
