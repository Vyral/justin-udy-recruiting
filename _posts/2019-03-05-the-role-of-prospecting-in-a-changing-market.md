I’m excited to bring you my latest message on what to do in a changing market. If you haven’t already, be sure to [check out my earlier videos](https://utahrealestatetraining.com/prepare-yourself-for-our-2019-market.html){: target="_blank"} on the topic. &nbsp;

Being prepared for changes our market will continue to endure is a must in the world of real estate. As many as 85% of agents are out of the business within their first five years, and that number shoots up to 98% for agents that make it 10 years. &nbsp; &nbsp;

**To avoid becoming part of the statistic, prospecting is integral to your success.** This is far from everyone’s favorite part of the job, but there’s a succinct phrase to consider: A closed mouth will never get fed. It’s a simple rule, but fundamentally important to remember. The only way you can grow your business and stay in business is through prospecting.&nbsp;

The market forecast for 2019 was clear—along with a rise in market prices, we will have fewer sales. Accounting for this, you’ll need to make the most of your opportunities and employ the most effective strategies.&nbsp;

Organize the business you’ll acquire into these three categories:&nbsp;

* **Today business.** These are prospects that have to act with immediacy, and they include For Sale By Owner (FSBOs), sellers that have a short window of time to move, etc. &nbsp; &nbsp;
* **Tomorrow business.** This is your follow-up business, or those who aren’t ready to act just yet but will be relatively soon. This includes those with a lease that’s nearing its end or those who are a month or so away from getting into the market.
* **Passive business.** This mode of business is centered around your consistent outreach and will come from your friends, family, and others close to you.

**On top of that, you need to make it your mission to master five facets of your prospecting, effectively becoming a specialist in those areas;** examples are calling FSBOs unrelentingly, mailing people in your sphere of influence each and every month, and door knocking at least once a week, just to name a few. &nbsp;

**Set daily standards for the number of contacts we make a day and compare those markers with last year’s standards.** By doing this, you can pinpoint your No. 1 income-opportunity source from the prior year, capitalize on that source further, and leave room to supplement your strategy with other sources as well.&nbsp;

**Lastly, cast aside past behaviors and focus on a mentality that will drive your success now and that you can carry into the future.** The best time to get ahold of people is in the morning and Thursday afternoon, so if you don’t succeed at one of those times, try the other.&nbsp;
