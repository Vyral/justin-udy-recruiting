Today I wanted to bring you an exciting announcement: On June 6th, I’m going to be hosting a training seminar on the top 10 things a brand-new agent should do. Even if you aren’t exactly brand-new, this class is still a great learning opportunity for any agents who aren’t selling at least 20 homes a year. Space for this class is limited, though, so be sure to **[RSVP here](http://google.com){: target="_blank"}** if you plan on attending. The event will take place in the ALV Mortgage office (7390 Creek Road Suite 201, Sandy, UT) and will run from 11:00 AM to 1:00PM. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to seeing you on June 6th.
