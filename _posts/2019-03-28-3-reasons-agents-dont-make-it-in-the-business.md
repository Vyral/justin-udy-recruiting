Here’s a statistic for you: 87% of real estate agents will be out of the industry within their first five years on the job.&nbsp;

In order to continue fueling your own success so that your career in real estate doesn’t suffer the same fate, consider and avoid these three common reasons for failure:&nbsp;

**1. Those who fail are not committed.** Unfortunately, many enter this career with misguided expectations—business will come knocking on their door and the phone will ring off the hook from the moment they begin. We as committed professionals know that this is a lead-generating business, which is why establishing a prospecting schedule is imperative. Those who’ve demonstrated a commitment to this business know that their time should be devoted to prospecting, lead generating, attending appointments, and negotiating deals.

**2. They can’t sell homes.** I’ve met quite a few people who possess the gift of gab, but their shortcomings are in their sales skills. This is a script-and-dialogue business, and it’s our job to effectively communicate with our clients, lead them, and lay out all their options. This means we need to understand scripts and tonality when helping clients reach a well-informed, maximally beneficial decision. &nbsp;

**3. They quit after a few bad experiences.** Rejection in this business is something we’re all accustomed to. It becomes problematic when the agent internalizes this experience and it weighs on their ability to move forward and maintain the attitude that they’re going to create more business. This self-doubt and insecurity tends to lead to excuses, and it spills over into other facets of their life; sadly, this only compounds the issue further. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Don’t let yourself fall into the psychological loop of “can’t.” I can’t tell you how many agents I’ve met with that suffer from being in their own heads. As you press on and begin to do more business, you’ll realize that you’re only one deal away from getting your mindset right.&nbsp;
