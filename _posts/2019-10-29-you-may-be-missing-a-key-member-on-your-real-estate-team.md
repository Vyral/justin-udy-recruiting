Every single day in the real estate business, we’re always so busy. We have to deal with buyers, sellers, clients, title companies, mortgage lenders, and so many other people.

Statistically, **only 15% of the agents in the market have a true, full-time assistant**—and that is unnecessarily low. If I could go back in time, I would have hired a closing coordinator to help me grow my business much sooner.

**Here’s how a closing coordinator will help your team:**

* They can help in certain areas that we as agents may not be the best at in terms of the closing process.
* They help get the final steps and details of the closing process done in a timely manner.
* They provide a level of service to our clients that we may not have the time, energy, or ability to do given the busy nature of an agent’s job.

Having a closing coordinator on your team creates leverage and opportunity in your business, propelling your forward quicker and smoother than ever.

If you need any help creating leverage to improve your business, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to discuss my strategies with you.
